**Today's Progress**:
Today I created my first github repo and learned about the basics of git and how to use github

### Day 2, November 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned the basics of html and crated a boiler plate file for future coding done using html.

**Thoughts:**
Even though the actual amount of content I went through is very little, I feel like I have learned a lot about how a website works and its structure. I would keep going but I have a midterm tomorrow, so expect more learning per day in the future

**Link to work:** 
none

### Day 3, November 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned how to add different kinds of text elements and a lot of tags for html. I also learned how to attatch links and  images to a website

**Thoughts:**
For now I think it is just a lot of memorizing, I need a lot more practice to get familiar with all the different html tags and make the most out of them

### Day 4, November 17, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Today marks the day that I've complelted the html section of my course. This final bit of the section taught me how to add images with the <img> and links using <a> along with the different attributes and values that go with them. Overall I think html is pretty easy to learn, and I look forward to applying these knowledge in the future.

**Thoughts:**
I personally think that css is the exciting part of the course, and I am glad that I can finally start learning it. However, I will need some practice through the first project in the course, which is a purely html based recepie website 


### Day 5, November 18, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Completed my firsrt assignment on the Odin project. Even though the assignment itself is pretty easy, it helped me get practice using the different HTML tags and the git workflow.

**Thoughts:**
 Looking back I feel like I could have done more but I had a busy day working for my entrepreneurship team.

### Day 6, November 19, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
learned about some basic css
**Thoughts:**
Tried to squeeze in some learning but had a busy weekend from an event. Now that the event is finished I think I can spend a lot more time learning about front end development.

### Day 7, November 20, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Familiarized myself with the cascading nature of CSS, and did a lot of practice with it so I can be more familiar with using it along with html

**Thoughts:**
The cascading nature and the specificity of different properties was really confusing at first, but I am glad that I kept going and did not peek at the solutions. Today marks the day that I am 50% complete with my Foundations course in the odin project. Can't wait to keep progressing and build bigger projects.

### Day 8, November 21, 2023
**Today's Progress**:

**Today's Progress**:
Learned about how block and inline model works in CSS, and finished exercises 1 and 2 for that respective section in the odin project. Also tried to add styling to my odin recipes website

**Today's Progress**:
both days were spent on learning flexbox, forgot to log the previous day so I've decided to log both down on the same entry

### Day 13, November 26, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Finished all the exercizes on flexbox in the odin project, now I can move on and create a landing page 

**Thoughts**
This is defnitely the hardest part of the journey so far, a lot of the css started getting frustrating and I had to find different ways to organize my css file class names so they do not conflict. However this did train me to become a lot more proficient with using flexbox.

### Day 14, November 27, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Started working on my first html+css based webpage from the ground up. This was for the "Project:landing page" section of the Odin project. However i am adding my own twist to it.

### Day 17, November 30, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Learned about conditional statements and string oeprations in JavaScript

### Day 25, December 18, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Changed a lot of the etch a sketch software. Made the buttons functional and made the main feature usable (you can now draw)

**Thoughts**
I think that I am defnitely more familiar with Javascript now, and compared to before, I used a more functional appraoch rather than just straight up code, which made the code cleaner and different things reusable

**Thoughts**:
I look forward to learning c because I think it will be a great gateway to many things that I have never though about learning before. it also suits well with my major

The stuff i learned today in css was pretty easy, but it made me realize that I have made a lot of mistakes in my react habit tracker website.

### Day 44 January 13, 2024
