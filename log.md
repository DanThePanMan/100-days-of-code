# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1, November 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I created my first github repo and learned about the basics of git and how to use github

**Thoughts:**
Honestly it was pretty easy, I do have to get used to the workflow but i think i will get used to it eventually. going to start learning html and css tomorrow and finally make things.

### Day 2, November 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned the basics of html and crated a boiler plate file for future coding done using html.

**Thoughts:**
Even though the actual amount of content I went through is very little, I feel like I have learned a lot about how a website works and its structure. I would keep going but I have a midterm tomorrow, so expect more learning per day in the future

### Day 3, November 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned how to add different kinds of text elements and a lot of tags for html. I also learned how to attatch links and  images to a website

**Thoughts:**
For now I think it is just a lot of memorizing, I need a lot more practice to get familiar with all the different html tags and make the most out of them

### Day 4, November 17, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Today marks the day that I've complelted the html section of my course. This final bit of the section taught me how to add images with the <img> and links using <a> along with the different attributes and values that go with them. Overall I think html is pretty easy to learn, and I look forward to applying these knowledge in the future.

**Thoughts:**
I personally think that css is the exciting part of the course, and I am glad that I can finally start learning it. However, I will need some practice through the first project in the course, which is a purely html based recepie website 


### Day 5, November 18, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Completed my firsrt assignment on the Odin project. Even though the assignment itself is pretty easy, it helped me get practice using the different HTML tags and the git workflow.

**Thoughts:**
 Looking back I feel like I could have done more but I had a busy day working for my entrepreneurship team.

### Day 6, November 19, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
learned about some basic css
**Thoughts:**
Tried to squeeze in some learning but had a busy weekend from an event. Now that the event is finished I think I can spend a lot more time learning about front end development.

### Day 7, November 20, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Familiarized myself with the cascading nature of CSS, and did a lot of practice with it so I can be more familiar with using it along with html

**Thoughts:**
The cascading nature and the specificity of different properties was really confusing at first, but I am glad that I kept going and did not peek at the solutions. Today marks the day that I am 50% complete with my Foundations course in the odin project. Can't wait to keep progressing and build bigger projects.

### Day 8, November 21, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Learned about the box model of css and learned how to sue DevTools

**Thoughts:**
In my opinion it does seem pretty straight forwared, but it might get harder once I actually start building prjects

### Day 9, November 22, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Learned about how block and inline model works in CSS, and finished exercises 1 and 2 for that respective section in the odin project. Also tried to add styling to my odin recipes website

**Thoughts:**
Everything worked great until my class selector did not override my universal selector. going to leave that problem to future me


### Day 10 and 11, November 23/24, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
both days were spent on learning flexbox, forgot to log the previous day so I've decided to log both down on the same entry

**Thoughts:**
I think that this stuff is pretty easy, but I know that in its going to be way harder when I put them in practice

### Day 12, November 25, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Practiced Flexbox for the entire day today, excited to see what I can build from scratch

### Day 13, November 26, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Finished all the exercizes on flexbox in the odin project, now I can move on and create a landing page 

**Thoughts**
This is defnitely the hardest part of the journey so far, a lot of the css started getting frustrating and I had to find different ways to organize my css file class names so they do not conflict. However this did train me to become a lot more proficient with using flexbox.

### Day 14, November 27, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Started working on my first html+css based webpage from the ground up. This was for the "Project:landing page" section of the Odin project. However i am adding my own twist to it.

**Thoughts**
After the exercizes, this part is actually quite easy. I still have a quite bit to do but I think this is a multi-day process and I am for sure getting there.


### Day 15, November 28, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Finished the html css project. Going to move on to javascript in the future

**Thoughts**
Honestly I think that it is very fun. Finished it way faster than I thought and I am glad that I can make all the buttons functional through learning javascript.

### Day 16, November 29, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Learned about numbers in javascript

**Thoughts**
Honestly I think that the numbers in javascript are pretty wacky, its weird because it functions really differently from python but python is also dynamically typed.

### Day 17, November 30, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Learned about conditional statements and string oeprations in JavaScript

did some exercizes to get practice

**Thoughts**
I have some background in python programming, so this section is a breeze. However it does feel tedious to relearn syntax.


### Day 17, November 30, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Finished learning the fundimentals of javascript. Learned how to use devtools to debug javascript

**Thoughts**
Similar to yesterday, The section was pretty simple but the devtools section was fun
