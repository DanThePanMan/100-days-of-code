**Today's Progress**:
Today I created my first github repo and learned about the basics of git and how to use github

**Thoughts:**
Honestly it was pretty easy, I do have to get used to the workflow but i think i will get used to it eventually. going to start learning html and css tomorrow and finally make things.

### Day 1, November 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned the basics of html and crated a boiler plate file for future coding done using html.

**Thoughts:**
Even though the actual amount of content I went through is very little, I feel like I have learned a lot about how a website works and its structure. I would keep going but I have a midterm tomorrow, so expect more learning per day in the future
