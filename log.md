# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1, November 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I created my first github repo and learned about the basics of git and how to use github

**Thoughts:**
Honestly it was pretty easy, I do have to get used to the workflow but i think i will get used to it eventually. going to start learning html and css tomorrow and finally make things.

### Day 2, November 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned the basics of html and crated a boiler plate file for future coding done using html.

**Thoughts:**
Even though the actual amount of content I went through is very little, I feel like I have learned a lot about how a website works and its structure. I would keep going but I have a midterm tomorrow, so expect more learning per day in the future

### Day 3, November 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned how to add different kinds of text elements and a lot of tags for html. I also learned how to attatch links and  images to a website

**Thoughts:**
For now I think it is just a lot of memorizing, I need a lot more practice to get familiar with all the different html tags and make the most out of them

### Day 4, November 17, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Today marks the day that I've complelted the html section of my course. This final bit of the section taught me how to add images with the <img> and links using <a> along with the different attributes and values that go with them. Overall I think html is pretty easy to learn, and I look forward to applying these knowledge in the future.

**Thoughts:**
I personally think that css is the exciting part of the course, and I am glad that I can finally start learning it. However, I will need some practice through the first project in the course, which is a purely html based recepie website 


### Day 5, November 18, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Completed my firsrt assignment on the Odin project. Even though the assignment itself is pretty easy, it helped me get practice using the different HTML tags and the git workflow.

**Thoughts:**
 Looking back I feel like I could have done more but I had a busy day working for my entrepreneurship team.

### Day 6, November 19, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
learned about some basic css
**Thoughts:**
Tried to squeeze in some learning but had a busy weekend from an event. Now that the event is finished I think I can spend a lot more time learning about front end development.

### Day 7, November 20, 2023
**Today's Progress**:
Familiarized myself with the cascading nature of CSS, and did a lot of practice with it so I can be more familiar with using it along with html
**Thoughts:**
The cascading nature and the specificity of different properties was really confusing at first, but I am glad that I kept going and did not peek at the solutions. Today marks the day that I am 50% complete with my Foundations course in the odin project. Can't wait to keep progressing and build bigger projects.
